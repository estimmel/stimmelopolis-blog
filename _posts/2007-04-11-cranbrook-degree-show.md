we booked our tickets to go out to cranbrook for the upcoming degree show on the 21st of april a couple days ago and i'm kind of excited to get out there... it's kind of like a homecoming, but closer. it will be a short visit [ friday thru monday ] but fortunately, jess will be there and cy is having an opening of a solo show somewhere around town. i even hear ben will be there playing music! sounds like a blast! i'm so ready for a short break. in other news, i think it's about time i signed up for my next registration exam.... i have not been on top of that since taking the con. docs. test more than a month ago. and this blog certainly needs a make over... oh and there are those christmas cards i didn't send out, and two half finished christmas presents! sitting on my desk. um... i think i am behind. crap. i'm supposed to be hard at work.... focus, focus, focus... oh look PONIES!!!
