so... i posted a couple days ago about some of the security around campus... i thought it was kind of funny because it just seemed like a bit of a fiasco and a little absurd. anyway, i was standing outside my studio at about 11pm two nights ago talking to my sister on the phone since reception inside buildings seems to be less than satisfactory around here [ thank you cingular ] and i walked out to the edge of the parking lot by lone pine road and stood there by the gate... it was cold so i had a jacket on, a hat and gloves... while i am talking a car stops in the middle of the road about 50 yards from me and just sits there... i'm kind of watching it because that seems sort of strange, but it just sits there... after about a minute or so two other cars pull up behind it and i can see that it's a police car. at that point all of it's lights come on and he drives straight toward me and tells me to take my hand out of my pocket and walk toward him... then to sit on the ground and stop moving... from where i am standing to the studio is about 25 feet... i am here, along with many other people every night sometimes all night... i don't have my wallet on me because i'm just outside for a quick phone call... anyway, i get completely frisked by two police officers while two other police cars sit and watch [ seems like a lot of back up to me ] and then they determine that i am not the one they are looking for... really. one of the officers tells me "you understand why we stopped you right?" i said not really... he says "the police are looking for someone, you're standing out here with a hat and gloves on..." i told him i didn't know the police were looking for anyone and that i live here... that my studio and several of my colleagues are right in that building... that i am a graduate student at the art academy... he didn't seem to care...

anyway. that was exciting...
