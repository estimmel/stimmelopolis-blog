i was clearing out my email inbox [ trying to get to zero... hah, only 589 more... ] and i came across this list that i compiled probably two years ago for a friend and then sent to another friend and promised a Vol.2 at some point... maybe i'll have to do that one of these days. in the meantime here's the list [ sorry about the formatting... i'm not feeling well enough to fix it... well, maybe a little ] : 

## Movie List (Volume I) ## 

**La Jetee** - Chris Marker Dir.; b/w 30 minute short (composed [almost] entirely of still images) that inspired Twelve Monkeys 

**Eraserhead** - David Lynch Dir.; b/w Lynch's first feature, amazing sound and visuals, bizarre 

**Tetsuo Iron Man** - Shinya Tsukamoto Dir.; b/w Japanese language but very little dialogue; Inspired by Eraserhead; slightly disturbing 

**Tetsuo Body Hammer** - Shinya Tsukamoto Dir.; sequel to the above... in the same vein 

**Reservoir Dogs** - Quentin Tarantino Dir.; the best dialogue 

**True Romance** - Quentin Tarantino Writer (Tony Scott Dir.) 

**Pulp Fiction** - Quentin Tarantino Dir. 

**Jackie Brown** - Quentin Tarantino Dir. 

**Go** - Doug Liman Dir.; I have seen this movie more that 15 times... it may not be a 'great' film, but it's one of my favorites 

**Swingers** - Doug Liman Dir.; he also directed The Bourne Identity 

**Four Rooms** - four vignettes; one by Tarantino and one by Robert Rodriguez 

**El Mariachi** - Robert Rodriguez Dir. Spanish language; prequel to Desperado; great low budget action film 

**Pillow Book** - Peter Greenaway Dir.; amazing imagery; if you see any of his films see this one 

**The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover** - Peter Greenaway Dir.; the Greenaway film everyone know... 

**The Belly of an Architect** - Peter Greenaway Dir.; Brian Dennehy as an architect 

**Drowning by Numbers** - Peter Greenaway Dir.; not much plot, but one of my favorite of his films 

**Repo Man** - a classic, one of my favorite films 

**Mad Max** - classic Australian film... launched a career. 

**The Usual Suspects** - watch it again 

**Zentropa** - Lars von Trier Dir.; English / German language; b/w and color; beautiful cinematography 

**The Element of Crime** - Lars von Trier Dir.; some incredible imagery; film noir 

**The Idiots** - Lars von Trier Dir.; Danish language - not sure if you can find this w/ English subtitles; one of the Dogme95 films (www.dogme95.dk); this one may be difficult to watch for some 

**The Celebration (Festen)** - Thomas Vinterberg Dir.; Danish language; a Dogme95 film (the first!); very good film about family secrets... highly recommend. 

**The Wild Bunch** - Sam Peckinpah Dir.; great western 

**Once Upon a Time in the West** - Sergio Leone Dir.; epic western classic 

**Solaris** - Andrei Tarkovsky Dir.; Russian language; Steven Soderbergh is remaking this, but the original is fantastic... very long and slow; sci-fi 

**Stalker** - Andrei Tarkovsky Dir.; Russian language; unbelievably beautiful sets and cinematography 

**Run Lola Run** - Tom Tykwer Dir.; German language; same story told 3x with different endings; fast paced 

**Pi** - Darron Aronofsky Dir.; b/w; fast paced film about power and systems

**Breathless** - Jean-Luc Godard Dir.; classic 

**Blade Runner** - Ridley Scott Dir.; classic sci-fi 

**Alien** - Ridley Scott Dir.; classic sci-fi 

**City of Lost Children** - Caro and Jeunet Dir.; French language but very little dialogue; Jean Pierre Jeunet also directed Amelie; great vision 

**Delicatessen** - Caro and Jeunet Dir.; French language; hilarious dark comedy about troglodytes and cannibalism in a post apocalyptic France 

**Brazil** - Terry Gilliam Dir.; the master at work making a mockery of bureaucracies... hmm... West Hollywood? 

**Twelve Monkeys** - Terry Gilliam Dir.; sets 'stolen' from a famous (at least in architectural circles) visionary artist - Lebbeus Woods
