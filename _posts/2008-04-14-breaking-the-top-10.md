...at least for today. so, as you can see in my sidebar (at the bottom) i do a little running for my regular exercise. i try to keep it consistent at least and there are a few things i use to help entice me to keep going (aside from the guilt that comes from sitting at a desk all day at work and most of the time i'm at home surfing the web and furiously watching every episode of lost - currently starting season 4 - on [abc.com][] or netflix) one of which is a nice little website called, simply, [RunLog][]. it's being developed by [Takashi Okamoto][], an amazing designer who i unknowingly became a fan of when i first saw [2x4's website][] which he designed (check out the source for an easter egg). runlog is affiliated with the [physical language workshop][] at MIT and is an extremely simple calendar of my jogging history. the point of this site is to encourage you to run, not fiddle with customizing a website about running and it does a very good job at that. it also looks nice and works well, so that helps make me think less about trying make it my own. anyway, it has a top 10 list too (of course!) and because there aren't that many people using the site, there was always the possibility that my meager running history would make it to the front page as it were. well, that day finally came as you can see below! (don't ruin my glory by explaining that some algorithm pushes you off the list if you haven't run in the last week - i realize this and i still celebrate dammit)

i also use the [Nike+ iPod Nano thingy][] for calculating the distance and blah blah blah from my runs... it works pretty well and automates a lot of the process which is really nice. there's a [wordpress plugin][] which is what i have running in the sidebar - so good of Nike to have an API for this kind of stuff. :)
