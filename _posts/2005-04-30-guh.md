okay... so it's a quarter to 6am on saturday... just got out of lounge [after going to sleep at 6pm and waking up at 1am to the sounds of SRL] and finished talking to some old friends in SLO.... funny how seemingly distant parts of your life can crop up unexpectedly [tho welcome] at the most random moments... makes one think about the so called random events in life...

so, one of my friends is going back to grad school next year... didn't see that coming, but it's great... also found out that some friends are reading my random chicken scratchings here... that's sort of a surprise... didn't know that i might be discovered... but i welcome it. it's a pleasant and comforting thing to know that what i say or think or write resonates with other people... well, i guess i don't know if it really resonates, but at least it is there for the taking... for the contemplating... for posterity...

i feel like watching a movie... what to watch... what to watch... i wish i had something equivalent to listening to nomeansno... i'm listening to them now... they inspire me to resist stasis... the music, the attitude, the intelligent perspective on society... sometimes those canadians really have a unique and positive outlook.... well, okay,.,, maybe positive is the wrong word, but active... not complacent... 0+2=1... something to contemplate

maybe chunking express... haven't watched that one yet... have to get ready for tomorrow... enron:the smartest guys in the room.... that will be great... maybe even kung fu hustle... well... we'll see... goodnight... er, morning [argh, that word!!]
