so, as if i needed more exposure on the web, i have set up a [website][] for future development [please don't give me too much grief for the state of it at the moment... it's very, very much a work in progress] and perhaps the base of operations for some future projects...

anyways, it has another [blog][] [i know, just zip it] that is served from my web host... it runs on [WordPress][], an open source software that looks pretty robust and easy to use... even though it took me a little while to set it up [chalk that up to never having dealt with .php files or sql databases... like, ever] and the fact that it's open source usually means that it doesn't just do things for you, you have to kind of know a little bit about what is happening... which is fine, because it's usually better to know those things anyways... point being, i like it. and it will have content at some point. but we'll have to see how the ebb and flow of these various outlets changes what i do and where i do it... until next time...
