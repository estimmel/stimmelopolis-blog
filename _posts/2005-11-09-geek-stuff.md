so i'm doing some research to try to find the best option [ read: most affordable option ] for mobile wireless internet access for a school project and low and behold, i am referred to a project in a magazine i have sitting on my floor... unread of course... seems to do a lot of things i am currently struggling with so this is actually helpful. does not give me a cheap access method for mobile wireless internet though.

i also found this little device that will be coming out soon they say... this could be the answer to all my cel phone disgruntle-ments... now if only i didn't sign that two year service agreement! argh!
