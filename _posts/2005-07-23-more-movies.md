my movies for the last couple of days...

[His Girl Friday][]

- a fantastic movie that i, admittedly, have never seen [for shame i know]. you should watch it if you haven't. cary grant is great as is rosalind russell... such great dialogue, characters...

[Austin Powers in Goldmember][]

- a hilarious movie... haven't seen it for a while, but there are just so many great laughs to be had here. watch it again.

[Gosford Park][]

- i remember going to a theatre in LA right down the street from the Nuart [unfortunately i can't remember the name... The Regal maybe? ...well i'm pretty sure it was a Landmark Theatre or Laemmle or something anyway] with my friend bill and coming out of there just so much more excited about movies... i believe bill's comment was that this is one of those kinds of films that he has to be encouraged to go see, but just loves after going to see it... i sympathize with that position because i know there are many films i miss because the topic or the genre or some other superficial characteristic isn't my cup of tea... i hope i am getting past that, but i know it's still a factor...

i've also been watching the commentaries and making of's on all these dvds... i love to hear people talk about their work... especially work that involves lots of participants such as movie making.
