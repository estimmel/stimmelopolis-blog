it's time for me to sleep... i've had some studio success coupled with many long hours of making that is now unneccessary as a result of that success [ isn't that always a bitch ]... but now i'm laying here in bed and i can't sleep... i didn't sleep last night at all and only caught about an hour on dharmesh and marty's couch this afternoon. so why can't i sleep. i'm tired... i'm having a tough time typing [ that could be partially due to the position i'm sitting/laying in ] and i even have the slight onset of a headache... i just watched garden state. it makes me think of falling in love and that makes me happy. i'll try to go to sleep with those kinds of thoughts rolling around in my head. tomorrow will be for work, laundry, grad book [ ugh, already a day late ], and clear-headedness. perhaps a new update on the old studio blog will be in order... maybe something big... maybe...
