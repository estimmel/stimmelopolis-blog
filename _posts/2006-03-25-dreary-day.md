so today is dreary, overcast, rainy, trying to snow.... all i seem to be able to think about is coming up with a new nic for my online self... 'estimmel' seems too boring lately... but i can't really come up with something else fun 'cept 'hollywood' or 'hollyw00d' or 'ho11yw00d' but i really don't want to use too much of that hacker talk... whatever... maybe i'll just go watch a movie... [inside man][] looks good... oh, and my mom sent me this picture from my christmas vacation... a kind of unintentional 'meet the parents week'... don't we just look so happy. :) [![meet the parents][]][1]
