i also wanted to mention that i had my first video/IM experience the other day... it was pretty cool and i got to see a smile i haven't seen for awhile... the delay inherent in, dare i use the phrase, long-distance relationships is something special... it draws out a part of that relationship that could [and often does] get compressed and passed by without note. i'm thankful to have that extention... that deep breath... that ellipsis...
