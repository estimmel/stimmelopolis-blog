i finally got around to looking at the [Creative Commons][] website and decided that i like it... so i've added a license to my blog here and for my studio work... i've also encouraged my fellow students to take a look at this and offered to help them put a CC license on their work too... we'll see if anyone cares... or reads their email... or... well, whatever. maybe i'm just cynical... anyways, the site is seriously one of the easiest legal sites i have ever waded through... and it's free... and they even have step by step instructions, with screen captures [which i really like] to show you how to add a CC license you all of the common blogging service's blogs...

so check it out... takes about 10 minutes...
