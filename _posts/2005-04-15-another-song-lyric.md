i just kind of like this song... and it has a chorus that resonates with me and some things i've been thinking lately... and there's this great pink floyd-esque riff in it that always reminds me of the tornado in the wizard of oz...

scream
ima robot

Big blue in a gasfield, you caught me lyin'
Pathetic religion of sex and cryin'
I nailed the door shut to leave you blind
I nailed the door shut for peace of mind

You were the best love I ever had
You hit me high, you hit me low
Time doesn't slow down for those who dream
I wake only to hear this scream

Hot and cold in the goldmine, the diamond legs
After she hit me off, I just had to beg
I nailed the door shut to leave you blind
I nailed the door shut for peace of mind

You were the best love I ever had
You hit me high, you hit me low
Time doesn't slow down for those who dream
I wake only to hear this scream

You were the best love I ever had
You hit me high, you hit me low
Time doesn't slow down for those who dream
I wake only to hear this scream

You were the best love I ever had
You hit me high, you hit me low
Time doesn't slow down for those who dream
I wake only to hear this scream

Love is the only incident
An infatuation
Is this sweet manipulation?
Well, I was frightened myself
What is love?
It's a fine inclination
A lovely retardation
What is life but a reality vacation?
Indulging operation
What is love?
The worthiest damnation
Sweet temptation
What is love?
