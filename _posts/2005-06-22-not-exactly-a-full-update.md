...but a couple links about detroit.

sadly, a couple days ago, the [original Studebaker plant][] burned to the ground in detroit. as i sat in the in the dorm lounge with andy and erin upgrading my laptop os to tiger and generally being slightly bored we decided to drive downtown and see what was visible from the freeway. as it happened we were able to get quite close and decided to park and walk closer... surprisingly we were allowed [with a multitude of other onlookers] to walk to within a half block of the blaze on more than one side... it was a five alarm fire and apparently there was no hope of saving the building, only of protecting the surrounding structures... if you browse back on my camera phone pictures, you will see some pretty dramatic shots of the fire... [around [here][]]

also while i was looking at old pictures of the building at the link above, i came across some pictures of [jeff's project][] which i participated in... not much there, but i was surprised to stumble onto it...

last note: i came across [this article][] on detroit in one of my mailing lists... sounds interesting. maybe one of these days i'll get through the second half...

that's all for now...
