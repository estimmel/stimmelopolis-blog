[Archartis - mapping the Built Environment][]

so... a friend of mine is working on this project that's an implementation of the Google Maps API for mapping the locations of well known works of architecture. you can get to it above... i guess he's still calling it an alpha version so it might not work, but if you're looking for some building's address or know where something is and want to know something else about it, check it out. you can add things too...

also, this is my first blog post using [Flock][]... i'm kind of into it. i started a [del.icio.us][] account too just because of it... i might like that...
