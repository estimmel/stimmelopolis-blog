this one isn't really about "going out of the city to see an art museum" as much as it is just about going out of the city. we went to a friend's wedding in [Glencove][] last weekend ( the weekend before Thanksgiving ) and took the opportunity to stay out there for the night and the following day. first of all, the wedding was a [Sikh wedding][] which was a new experience for me. it was both much more informal than i was expecting and everything that i imagined. there was a lot of music performed by three older men playing something like accordions. i'll have to look up the name, but they were these sort of mini air powered organs. we received two meals during the course of the wedding and were not allowed to sit next to each other. unfortunately we didn't have a good camera to take pictures, but here's a couple shots of us before we went into the temple and of the tv showing a live feed of the alter...

the reception was at a different location, [Bethpage][]. we had some time to kill and Bethpage is very close to [Levittown][], which, if you remember you architectural history, is the [original suburb][]. i, of course, did not remember this, but we decided to check it out nonetheless... preparation would have been the key word here since we really didn't see much of anything that seemed to warrant a field trip. that said, we were unprepared and at least we didn't have to go far to check into our hotel where we proceeded to watch [Big Daddy][] for the next couple of hours before heading to the reception. the reception was a lot of fun... good indian and chinese food. we met some really nice people who we will probably not see again, but that's how weddings go i suppose. here are a couple shots we took at the reception.

the following day we went to the [Sands Point Preserve][] and spent the day hiking through the forest and along the coast of the long island sound. it was a beautiful weekend for this trip and although we missed the tours of the more restricted areas ( out of season... ) we were able to find some good fall colors and very peaceful walking paths. here are a few pictures... more of all of these can be found by following the links.
