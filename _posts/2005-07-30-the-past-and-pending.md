i'm just going to write about this here because i have been listening to this song over and over and over again in my truck and my room [ but mostly in my truck ] and i think it really captures my mood lately... the music more than the words, but the words too... there were a few places where i couldn't understand the words [ not uncommon ] but one was the last line of the chorus which made me smile when i finally read the lyrics...

the song reminds me of a lot of things, but the one thing that i pulled from way back is the french horn... i don't think about the french horn much, but when i was in high school my second band teacher was a french horn player [ the first one was a drummer ] i can't remember his name [ the drummer was perry hall i think ] and it kind of frustrates me when i can't remember things like that... anyway, he was a french horn player and i really didn't know much about the french horn or what it could do at the time... i suppose it might not be a french horn in the song, but it reminded me of him all the same... he was a nice guy and i have a lot of memories from my years in the school band... maybe i'll get to talking about some of those one day in here, but for now, here's the song...

the past and pending [ [\*][] ]  
the shins  

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn  
We settle down to cut ourselves apart.  
Cough and twitch from the news on your face  
And some foreign candle burning in your eyes  

Held to the past too aware of the pending  
Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale.  
Enter the fog another low road descending  
Away from the cold lust, you house and summertime.  

Blind to the last cursed affair pistols and countless eyes  
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running  
Feed till the sun turns into wood dousing an ancient torch  
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love.  

Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay  
Offer me little but doting on a crime.  
We've turned every stone and for all our inventions  
In matters of love loss, we've no recourse at all.  

Blind to the last cursed affair pistols and countless eyes  
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running  
Feed till the sun turns into wood dousing an ancient torch  
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love.
