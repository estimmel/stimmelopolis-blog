so... playing around with some roll over magic on my [joglog][]... check it out... roll over the images... also, playing around with extracting the path as a .GPX file from the [pedometer][] page using a tool i found [here][]... then loading that onto a [google maps instance of my own][]... hopefully i can figure out how to do this more interactively... but for now, i'm back on the google maps bandwagon.
