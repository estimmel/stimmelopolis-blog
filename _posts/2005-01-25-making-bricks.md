off making bricks... we had the gallery opening [actually the reception was a closing... but don't worry about the technicalities] for a show called 'dive into repetition.' this was a collaboration between some architecture students and some ceramics students. it was a success! even if ben and i barely finished hanging our piece before the guests showed up... [typical]

anyways, i am still working on the project because i have a crit friday and will be presenting this work... hopefully with some more quantity and understanding... however i have been slacking a little lately... played 4 hours of pool last night and never went back to studio...

now i must work hard.
