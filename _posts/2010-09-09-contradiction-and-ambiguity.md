Brings to mind several conversations I've had in the past (and some I'm confident I will have again) but one special, perhaps momentous, conversation stands out. Sadly it has been recounted often enough to be left to the imagination here. PS - I think this Stephenson guy might have a future. Really enjoying The Diamond Age. (Yes, I know is old. Yes I've read his other work. No, not all of it... The books are very long, I'm working on it.)
