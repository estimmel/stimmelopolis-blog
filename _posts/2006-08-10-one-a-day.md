alright... i need to get working on stuff... there was a very talented colleague of mine at cranbrook who was diligent about doing one-a-days, small projects started and completed in one day... now, i don't think this concept was his [ maybe, probably, it was a proposal from the artist in residence ] but i think he was more successful at it than most. not to say he actually completed one everyday, but he did a lot. i've thought of doing this in the past and never got around to it and i'm sure i won't start today [ looking for a job is taking up quite a bit of my time as is preparing to move to another state ] but this is my personal reminder to start working on it... i think it will be a good way for my to actually start making some things that are useful and cool on the web without muddling around with perfecting something forever... do it and move on... i have tons of webspace available and this can be a little portfolio filler material... build a building in sketchup and put it in google earth... make a series of animated gifs and put them on my website... make a qtvr of something and publish it... make a flash animation... write a perl script or applescript to help me update my jlog [ the new name for my joglog as soon as i update it ;) ] that's it for now... more posts are coming, i just have to finish them!
