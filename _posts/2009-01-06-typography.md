It's been awhile since I worked on this blog at any great length and as I look back over it I see that I have made the forthcoming promise to 'pick it up again' more than once - one might say more often than not! That being the case, I'm finally starting to feel like I have got it to a point where I can stand to look at the thing and that's a large part of the battle for someone like me. I have a theme that is tweaked enough that I feel I can claim some small amount of credit for the aesthetic, but not so much that it's breaking on every new page view. There is still some progress to be made - for instance, regularizing the sidebar. It pains me to look at all those horizontal lines somehow not lining up! I'll probably also have to explore getting some of those excessive links onto a new page so the main page is less cluttered. Then there are the categories and tags and getting [Markdown][] to work as well as figuring out a consistent posting schedule... but i digress. I'll leave you with a couple of typographic symbols that I learned about as I was wasting time surfing the web doing research. The first is called an [asterism][] and is used to call attention to a passage or separate subchapters in a book. It looks like three asterisks set in a triangle as such:

⁂

The second is called a [tombstone][] which signifies the end of a proof and looks like a filled square as such:

And with that, I'll solemnly swear (up and down and with a flourish!) to pick this blogging thing up again for 2009. See you soon. ∎
