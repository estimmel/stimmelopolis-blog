i love getting new books... and today i got three....

* Knoppix Hacks ([O'Reilly][])
* Wireless Hacks ([O'Reilly][])
* The Critique of Judgement by Immanuel Kant - translated by J.H. Bernard [i don't know if this is the preferred translation, but it was the cheapest...]

i also 'reviewed' a couple reference books that a friend recommended...

* The Highly Selective Dictionary for the Extraordinarily Literate
* The Highly Selective Thesaurus for the Extraordinarily Literate

both by Eugene Erlich... very good, but i couldn't force myself to spend the money for something that would, unfortunately, not be used much... i find that i use the internet and it's various search engines and wikis a much more readily available resource... and as i discovered not too long ago [trillian][] [my IM client of choice for PC lately - see [fire][] for mac] links directly to wikipedia for almost all the things you type into it... very nice...

i also finished [at least i hope i have finished... much work needs to be done after this part] coating my cardboard forms with epoxy resin... now i just have to figure out how to clean up the mess... ugh.
