i got a package from [digikey][] with one of the key components to my next project. it's a magnetic stripe reader... i'm going to rewire it so that i can discover what info is on my credit cards and so forth...

last night i watched part of the shaye saint john dvd "[shaye saint john: the triggers compilation][]" ... it is insane... i just linked to the dvd order page, so if you get back to the main page of the site do so at your own risk... it's not for everyone... it deals with a lot of strange social taboos and borrows from some greats in cinematic history but with a completely new and disturbing twist...

today there was something big going on at the high school... it might have been the graduation or the graduation brunch or part of the reunion thing or something other, but the town is full of people and the campus has been overrun with people and events... it's kind of a nice change from the utter lack of people that have been here for the past week... it also kind of sucked when someone blocked in my truck and andy's van... luckily i have the keys to dharmesh's truck so i was able to get out and do what i needed off campus. i hate when people are so inconsiderate... i was this close to having it towed...

oh well... my frustration disappeared later in the evening when i ventured into dearborn for the third [dorkbot:detroit][] event... it was held in the upstairs meeting room of [green brain comics][] and consisted of three performances [ one individual and two collaborative ] by three electronic musicians. it was very intimate [ perhaps 9 people in attendance including the musicians ] but they were all very cool and i look forward to maybe participating in the future... anyways, like i said very low key, but inspiring and definitely something new...
