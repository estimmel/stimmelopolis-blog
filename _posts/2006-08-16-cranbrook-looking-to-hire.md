[Archinect : Jobs : Director, Cranbrook Academy of Art and Art Museum][]

well, we [ the students past ] received an email announcing Gerhardt's stepping down awhile earlier in the summer... but i guess now it's public. seems like a big transitional time, these couple of years here... last year Peter Lynch stepped down from the architecture residency and next year will see the end of Gary Griffin's tenure in metals as well as [ i believe ] Jane Lackey from fiber... and of course Gerhardt Knodel as the director...

big changes for all...
