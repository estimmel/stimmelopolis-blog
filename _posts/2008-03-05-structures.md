yes, i am actually *not* studying at this particular moment... but my diversion is related. as i've been reading through the wonderfully engaging ALS book *Structural Technologies 2* for my test tomorrow!! i came across a 'Notable Engineer' by the name of [John Roebling][] which stood out immediately since i have enjoyed eating at the [Roebling Tea Room][] and often drive down Roebling Street in Williamsburg on my way to dinner or the grocery store. however, i was not aware that he ( and his son Washington ) were responsible for the design and construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. apparently i *am* learning. incidentally, in my initial link search for confirmation, i discovered that Emily Roebling ( daughter to John Roebling ) was ["...considered to be the person in charge of the day to day construction of the Brooklyn Bridge."][]
