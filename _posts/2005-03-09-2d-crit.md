well, i had the crit on my [and jessica's] project entitled 'assisted speaking devices' today... it was a pretty resounding success... the process of critique in that department is slightly different than that in our department and frankly i like it a lot better... of course i didn't feel that way initially, more just interested in the process, but after sitting through many i feel like it puts more pressure on the work and less on the speaking-at-the-crit moment which can be a moment of fast talking to evade critical issues or a moment when you can explain away poor design [or lack of design]... more focus on the work and less on the talking your way through an incomplete project... desk crits will suffice for that i think.

anyways, i will upload some pictures to this and my studio blog later... don't have them here and haven't attempted to figure out how to upload images from a mac... but suffice it to say that the work was well received and functioning for the crit. hooray!! now, on to chair design and waiting for friday's crit...
