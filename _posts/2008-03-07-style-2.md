cascading style that would be. you'll notice that i've been tweaking the blog a little lately. ( nothing like a little [yak][] [shaving][] to get me motivated ) anyway, there are fun things in the sidebar now so you can see my latest jogging stats and some selected links from [delicious][] and [google reader][] and you can [buy some books][] that i'll get a small percentage on... also, i've started tinkering with the CSS files as well. and thanks to [CSSEdit][] i can actually make sense of them. this is the greatest tool for visualizing what's going on in those horrifying wordpress theme cascading style sheet files. i'm not saying you should judge it's usefulness based on my webdesign skills, but i was actually able to make some changes ( for the better i think ) so that's that. i'm sure there are going to be some lingering issues with my modifications and i'd be much obliged if you sent me a little note or left a comment when you come across something. cheers.
