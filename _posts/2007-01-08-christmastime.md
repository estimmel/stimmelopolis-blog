i'm back in brooklyn again after a short week in california. it was fun and even though the weather has been great here in new york [ 70 degrees yesterday!!! and beautiful skies! ] it's just not the same as california. so here are a couple pictures and a little video clip of the one afternoon that me and jenn and amy and jp got to hang out on the beach. it was really windy...
