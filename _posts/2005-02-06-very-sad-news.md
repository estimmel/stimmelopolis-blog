i got an email today [two actually - one from my dad and one from a friend] bearing the same bad news... a dear friend of mine who had a stroke near the end of last year is not expected to make it through the night due to complications as a result of that stroke. her name is betty byron and she has been a friend and counselor to me for somewhere btwn 10 and 15 years... she was a wonderful person who always brought joy to me and everyone she met... my heart is heavy as i write this and i don't have the words to express my sadness.

i will miss you betty and i will hold the memories i have of you close to my heart.
