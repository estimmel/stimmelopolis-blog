i am on a quest for the perfect [for me] gps solution... i decided the other day that the garmin eTrex legend i currently have isn't the one. actually i decided that awhile ago, but i just listed it on [eBay][]yesterday. it's great, but not enough compatibility. needs to work with my [mac][] and my [pda][] ... i am looking at a puck style receiver to use with a software mapping solution. any ideas?? i am looking at the [earthmate][] currently... a little cheaper than the handheld type, but still not cheap enough. hopefully the popularity of it will help me in the long run... more apps, support, compatibility...

i have also been looking at personal tracking devices that use gps like [Wherify][] but i don't know a whole lot about them... more research... more digging... testing... hopefully toward something interesting...
