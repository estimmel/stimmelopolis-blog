> I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it. - Thomas Jefferson

so with that in mind i am trying to work a little harder... went [jogging][] yesterday for the first time in 8 months! yikes... hopefully i can get one more in tomorrow before leaving for michigan on friday. not sure what that will bring... counting on inspiration... at the very least seeing some old friends. :) on a related note, while fumbling around the web i stumbled onto [Noah Kalina][] and his picture a day project. there i found reference to ( a familiar name from Cranbrook ) Jonathan Keller's [daily photo project][] as well as a project called [Slitscan Typeface Generator][] which uses scripting ( i guess some kind of javascript ) in Adobe Illustrator.... i didn't even know you could write scripts for illustrator... but it generated illustrator files of his initials ( you can see jpegs of those file below and read about the process at the link above ) and provided a different kind of mail art project ...not sure what i would do with this script, nor the files, considering it generates only a 'J' and a 'K' and there's a second part to the script that i don't even have access to that is processed by JK himself... but i really like the way the project creates a short little conversation. and the images look cool. there are lots of cool things on the web and a pretty good concentration can be found at the links above.
