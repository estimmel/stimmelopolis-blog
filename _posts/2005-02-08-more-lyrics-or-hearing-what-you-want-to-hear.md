so i've listened to this song quite a few times on the radio, on itunes, put it on a comp. cd and still have a few questions about the lyrics in a few places... well really only one place after transcribing them... [so if you know them or have a link i'd love to see it] anyways, i always thought the first line said "feel sick without you and i can't let you go / i told you i don't want you but you don't let me say no" which changes the meaning significantly i think... anyways, here's what i got...

primitive (the way i treat you) [from Ambulance Ltd]
by Ambulance Ltd

feel sick without you and i can't let you grow
i told you i don't want to but you don't let me say no
i drop a wire to your mom and your dad
saying relax, don't think about the way i treat you [huh]

shake humble hands with a faraway neighbor
take part in something you can sure understand
you're now allergic to the rumble and noise
so relax, don't think about the way i treat you [uh-huh]

well i've got the time and i've found the way
and i really want you and you really want to

???
he drove his brand new sports car on a national campaign
he's not affected by the rallies and wars
he says relax, don't think about the way i treat you [believe me]

you learn to balk at a comfortable slumber
proceeding only toward sure history
you don't remember and it's not important
so relax, don't think about the way i treat you

well i've got the time and i've found the way
and i really want you and you really want to (repeat...)

relax, don't think about the way i treat you (repeat...)
