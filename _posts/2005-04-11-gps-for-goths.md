okay so this isn't really new, and i haven't had time to digest the possible implications of this project, but i have to say that it seems interesting in that it uses gps devices in a way that i hadn't really thought about before... in this project, which can be found [ [here][] ] gps devices are worn by a number of people [perhaps unknown to all of the other users] and used kind of like a compass... the devices point to the geographic center of all the active devices... it's call 'the calling' and so rather than pointing north, like a standard compass, it 'calls' one toward the center of their group... kind of... anyways, i think there are some great possibilities for something like this... i'll have to think about it some more...
