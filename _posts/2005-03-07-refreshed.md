well, so much for the 9am meeting... i made it until about 7:30 and then i guess i just crashed... woke up to strange dreams that have left me with nothing but an unsettled feeling at about 1pm... i suppose i needed that sleep, i feel much better now as i sip my coffee and think about the leftover pasta salad in the fridge...

i have yet to assemble the audio components of my project and worry that the sound will be muffled by the casing and that the microphones won't pick up enough sound... but those worries will soon be addressed... in the meantime here are some images from one component's packaging... enjoy... feel safe in knowing that there are ways to ward off the villians in the world..
