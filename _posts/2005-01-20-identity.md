i was talking to a friend of my the other day who is uncomfortable about displaying his identity online... now, while i don't exactly think the reasoning behind this conversation has any real grounding in a concern for privacy [probably shouldn't get into that one... i might be discovered since this blog isn't hiding my identity very well] or even much of an understanding of what it would entail to protect one's identity online generally, it did start me thinking about my online identity...

it has also prompted me to compile a list of where i appear online... not that i intend to publish that here... but maybe... i have to think about that one.

at any rate, petty quibbles seem to be the pet peeve of the day... my own and those of others... i will have to work on that. i guess it's true that what you are most critical of in others is what you are most dissatisfied with in yourself. hmmm... food for thought.
