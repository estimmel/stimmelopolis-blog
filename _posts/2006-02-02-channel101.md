[My Statement to the Wall Street Journal re: House of Cosbys][]

so... this is Dan Harmon, the founder/producer/distributer/whatever of andy's favorite 'tv' channel, channel101.com in a statement about a cease and desist order and the threat of legal action by bill cosby's people... i haven't seen the show, but i've seen plenty of other shows on channel101 and i can say they are seriously funny. low budget in the extreme, but fuuuunnnny.

anyway, i thought i would post this little quote because i liked it... the whole statement is pretty good, really of the now. i'll be watching to see how things turn out...
