i'm excited about blogger's [blogger images][] which was announced just two days ago [ i think ] because it means that i can now blog from my mac!!! hopefully... let's try it.

[![image1][]][1]well... some formatting issues [like the ability to wrap text around an image or not to do that] have to be figured out... and i had three or four tries that failed to upload an image here... once i had two images here, but in trying to post it they disappeared... let's try to post this one first.
