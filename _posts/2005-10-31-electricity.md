here's some reassuring [background info][] on working with electricity...

> If you have never worked with electricity or don't know the difference between AC & DC this page is not for you. Unlike making your own clothes or growing your own food, which if done wrong is little more then embarrassing or unpalatable, mistakes in making or working with electricity can ***burn down your house or kill you***. If you don't have any experience working with electricity, hire someone that does or take a class in basic electricity at your local collage.

hahahaha... man... bookmark this site!! [emoticon][] ... [ my emphasis of course ] ...
