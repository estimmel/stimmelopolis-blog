so, it's 6am and i am still in studio... feeling better about the level of completion of my project, but i've scaled back my expectations a couple times as well... it was supposed to be an installation and a sort of how-to manual... the aesthetic of the installation increased this afternoon, but that meant more construction and another trip to home depot tomorrow [check that, today] and most likely no manual for the 2D crit... there's always the arch. crit friday, but i really wanted to crit something graphic in 2D... oh well, there will be another one...

it's odd to consider the varied forms of dialogue that have become part of my life since moving to michigan... i instant message with friends out of state to keep in touch, i instant message people that i have rarely spoken to on the phone, i instant message people in other rooms in the same building that i just saw five minutes ago, i text message people to remind them that i am still kicking around, i read private/public blogs that refer to me by not using my name, i write things in my blog that answer comments that may or may not have been meant for me... always these direct and indirect text based dialogues contain a level of ambiguity that is comforting in the lack of immediate confrontation and the inherent understanding of delay and brevity... but there is something disheartening about this always present mediation and that is the lack of a physical immediacy...

the result of that is that we cope. for better or for worse, we manage to get by without hanging out at our best friend's house doing nothing but playing play station games for twelve hours straight; without hearing the shuffle of papers in the other room and knowing that's mom; without hearing dad snoring on the couch on a sunday afternoon; without having a quiet cup of coffee and feeling the proximity of someone special... [no conversation that could be considered 'conversation', just being in the same vicinity] ...the downside is that we find a way to make due without those things... i guess that's just how it is and you're only to blame if you don't recognize that and hold it dear when you have it...

sleep calls me, but the day is just beginning and it's a long one... meeting at 9am to kick it off... better go move my truck.
