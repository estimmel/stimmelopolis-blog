it's funny to miss someone that you rarely see... this was pointed out to me a few days ago and it makes sense, but it still happens... i could elaborate, but i'm not feeling real wordy tonight. a little talked out and tired.

on a similar note, it seems those pesky conversations that previously i did not know how to end have solved themselves; just have the cel phone drop your call... hehe. well, it's wonderful to hear a voice from halfway around the world even for a brief moment. some people are so thoughtful. :-)

just thought i would make a note of it.
