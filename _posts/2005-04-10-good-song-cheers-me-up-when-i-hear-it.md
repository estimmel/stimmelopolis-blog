so i was listening to this mix cd i got from a friend of mine awhile back... seems like it was in return for the use of my season 1 and 2 episodes of alias [yes, i know... but i have a weak spot for the sexy woman espionage/action/scifi genre of tv show... she spies, VIP, alias, cleopatra 2525... all bad, but still good...]

anyways, i guess it really wasn't that fact that brought this cd out of my rather sparce collection of cds here [thank you itunes] but rather the fact that my cd collection is rather sparce here... and i hadn't listened to this one for some time... but i've been skipping to this song by jason mraz alot lately and i thought since i am about to watch an episode of alias right now, and i just listened to the song and smiled, that i would share the lyrics for others to enjoy too... i also like the fact that i found the lyrics online by searching for the the word lacubrius... an apparently made up word that just sounds cool, but now has a [definition][] in one of the more interesting dictionaries online...

i'll do anything
jason mraz

Go make your next choice be your best choice
And if you’re looking for a boy with a voice, well baby I’m single
Are you in the mood for some dude, are you in the mood to be subdued
Or would you rather just mingle? 
Let’s get set then to go then or let us jet set we’ll be like the jetsons
You can be jane my wife, should I marry jane tonight? 

See I would if I could I’ll do anything spontaneously.

We can keep chilling like ice cream fillin
We can be Kool and the Gang if you’d rather hang
Ain’t no thing, I can be lacubrious wit you
I got no ifs ands ors no wits or what’s about it
But this place is getting crowded and my house is two blocks away
Or maybe closer

See I would if I could I’d do most anything spontaneously.
You know I would, oh if I could I would do anything spontaneously.

If you could be nimble, you’d have it simple just like me.
So go on and try it, do not deny yourself your freedom.

So step on up to the plate get a date with mraz
See you better act fast because supplies they never
Now did you know this is limited time offer
So go make your mind up before our times up
So you better start winding it up because the party’s almost over
(and if you should know girl, it's a little bit lower now)

See I would do, if I could do. I’d would do oh anything spontaneously.
You know I would, oh and I could prove it oh that I’ll do anything spontaneously.
