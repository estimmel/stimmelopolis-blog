so i finally did it... i bought a new 12" Powerbook G4!! i'm so excited... the scrolling trackpad it a nice feature, but that's about all i have had time to play with for the moment... i am running software updates right now... and i have a meeting to go into, so it will be a few hours before i can really become acquainted with it... in the meantime, here are a couple bad photos that i snapped quickly...
