i have been following [this blog][] about style for some time now... i'm not sure why, but i just like looking at the people he finds interesting and reading the things he has to say about what they are wearing. mostly there are just photos of people standing on the street in milan or new york or tokyo or some other city, but recently there were two longer, atypical posts about Cary Grant and Fred Astaire that caught my eye. i must admit i don't have much of a studied familiarity with either of them... just a pop culture sort of familiarity. they were good reads, each laying out an argument favoring one or the other and their approach to their image. i guess i'm just recommending them for an interesting little read. and somewhere along the way i was inspired to rewatch a favorite movie of mine that i haven't seen for such a long time. more on that later. meanwhile, read... and let me know if you have any thoughts, favorite performances or movies of either Grant or Astaire... the last Cary Grant movie i can remember seeing is [His Girl Friday][] and i can highly recommend it.
