there is so much to do here and i haven't posted anything about it in such a long, long time. so, i don't really know where to begin... a couple of weeks ago i went to [Eyebeam][] to see a sort of performance/exposition at Upgrade!... it was three electronic musicians [ i can't remember all their names, but i'm sure it's archived on the eyebeam website somewhere ] here's a little clip of Jamie Allen.

jenn and i also recently painted our apartment. of course true to form, we are not finished yet... we cleaned as well, though you won't see that in the picture, since we have a guest coming for thanksgiving weekend! jenn's former roommate, birgitte is on her way as i write this... here's a view of the freshly painted west wall...

i know there are many more things to write, but i suppose i will just have to gain the discipline to write more often so i can keep up!

happy turkey day!!
