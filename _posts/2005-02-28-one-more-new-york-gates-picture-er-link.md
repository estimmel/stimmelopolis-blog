[panorama of central park][]

this panorama was put together by some other [not so] anonymous blogger who shared the elevator ride to the 20th floor of this building with me and nealy left me locked out, standing on the roof... well, i guess that was mostly my fault. i hope she doesn't mind me 'borrowing' her link so i don't have to piece together the panorama myself, hehe...

anyways, this [3rd] rooftop view was quite nice and i hope being reminded of it [the peaceful moment in the midst of the city] and the quiet side of the park [with its un-gated paths] that followed will break the melancholic spell of yesterday...

:-)
