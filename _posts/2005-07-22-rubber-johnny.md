okay. not for everyone, but on the [Chris Cunningham Director's Label DVD][] there is a promo for his new short film called [Rubber Johnny][]... now it's apparently on the internet [here][] among other places [although i can't be certain this is the actual movie] anyhow, it's got Aphex Twin music and perhaps the dude from AT as rubber johnny... can't really tell and i have to go get some gatorade so i'll have to check back later.

evidently the dvd comes with a 42 page picture book [why 42 pages? maybe it is the answer to the universe... i don't know] BUT as i have indicated at the top, this is not for everyone... the pictures shown on some [sites][] look like... well, let's just not discuss it... but if you watch the movie or see the pictures don't say i didn't warn you... hehe.
