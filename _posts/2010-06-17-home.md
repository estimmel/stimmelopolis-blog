Really grateful to [@sarhar1][] for showing me the most excellent video. There's just so much to love about this song and the people singing it that I won't even try to put it into words. Just watch it.

Of course a discovery like this can only be followed down the rabbit hole, i.e. YouTube, to discover more of the same, interesting and new (to me) music and imagery. I really like this one as well. Wishing I had some disposable income right about now... 

I also kind of dig the title fonts.
