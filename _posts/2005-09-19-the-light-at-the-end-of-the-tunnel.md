so, i can see it... the end of the desk project!! hooray!

it's 4:30am and we install tomorrow at 9... that means load everything up starting at 8, so get up at 7:30... that's 3 hours sleep.... :-/

well... it looks fantastic though... i'll try to post some pictures of the installation [ which should take two days ] and then the final piece... then... well, then i have many more projects waiting in the wings to fill the void. 

actually, i am very excited about this year... things may be slow getting set up in studio, but there is definitely no lack of work being done in there... the trailer has been attacked... camera's have been set up in the rafters to document the deconstruction [ or chopping ] and the reconstruction [ or editing ] ... i hope to get my hands dirty on that project and even get a webcam up to broadcast the progress to the world [ hooray ]

sleep calls... goodnight.
