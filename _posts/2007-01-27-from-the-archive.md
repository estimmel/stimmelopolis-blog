no, not that kind of archive... The Archive is a coffee shop and video store down the street from where i live... it's got free wifi, so jenn and i thought 'hey, let's go down there and post some pictures and blog this morning' but it's reeeeaaaaallll slow internet... so, as i sit here waiting for one image to upload to flickr i realize that that may in fact be what is making the whole network creak to a halt... i kind of feel guilty about that, but hey, it's only one picture and if that's what is bringing down the network that it's crappy to begin with... it is slowly posting tho ;)

....................................................

what have i been doing since i last posted?... lots i guess, i haven't posted anything for awhile [ i'm afraid to look at the last post because it will take forever to load, but i'm sure it was a long time ago since i can't even remember it!!! ] jeremy came to visit and we went out doing all kinds of touristy things... i guess we didn't need to do that, but we did. we saw the statue of liberty, went to the top of the empire state building, went to two hockey games at madison square garden, walked around central park, ice skating at bryant park [ okay, only jeremy actually ice skated ]... it was a fun visit! except that we were all sick :( i'll put some pictures up soon... you can see jenn on one of our outings discovering the hidden beauty of the subway station [ i forgot where this is... maybe someone remembers ] is here...
