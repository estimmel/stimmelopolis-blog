hesitation...

how do you hesitate in text... i recently discovered a new front in instant messaging... the mac 'rendevous' thing, which i haven't really played around with because i am generally online on my pc... my mac is old and slow and i generally don't use iChat because i only have an MSN client which iChat doesn't support... anyways, i digress [i always wanted to type that... hehe] right.

um, so rendevous... when you chat with a rendevous account it means you are on the same local network [i guess] and so as you type, it shows up to the other person letter by letter... or something approximating that. so you can physically see the person's hesitations. as they decide what word to use, change their thoughts midstream, don't say what they started out saying... even say something and intentionally erase it knowing that you read it or knew where the conversation was going...

there is a strange new conversation that can happen between the first letter typed and the last backspace... it's quite nice.

i had more to say about hesitation... that word has crept into my mind on more than one occasion this past week and i've thought many thoughts about the beauty of hesitating... but now i am tired... distracted from work... hesitant, perhaps...
