here i am... back in muggy michigan... it's really good to be here, even if [or maybe in part because] almost no one is here... i've had some time to walk around the campus, try to keep up my sketch-a-day habit which is difficult from lack of practice, decompress, unpack some things, get ready for some projects of my own [which may be forthcoming in some web based representation]... just sort of be a little lazy too i guess.
 
 anyways, i've been remiss in one matter... i received this very cool postcard [complete with instructions in four languages and a diagram showing how to remove the sticker] from basel of all places! and i keep forgetting to say thank you for that. i guess i am not always very good about thanking people when they mail me things, but i really do appreciate it!
 
 so here's a little picture of it... sorry it's a bit strange and you can't see the diagram, but my cheap little webcam didn't want to take a picture of it... so this is the best i could get... maybe i'll post another one from my phone...
