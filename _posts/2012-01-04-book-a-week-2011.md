Well, I didn't fulfill my goal of reading a book each week this past year, in fact I didn't even beat my number from 2010, but I did read several books this year as a result of the bookaweek challenge. I've listed them below in case you are keeping track or are just here looking for something good to read.

1.  [Gasoline][] by Quim Monzó
2.  [HTML5 For Web Designers][] by Jeremy Keith
3.  [The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo][] by Stieg Larsson
4.  [The Girl Who Played With Fire][] by Stieg Larsson
5.  [The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest][] by Stieg Larsson
6.  [On Writing][] by Stephen King
7.  [Cathedral][] by Nelson DeMille
8.  [The Shadow Of The Wind][] by Carlos Ruiz Zafón
9.  [How To Think Like A Computer Scientist - Learning With Python][] by Allen Downey
10. [Zer0 Day][] by Mark Rusinovich

In my defense I had a pretty busy year.
