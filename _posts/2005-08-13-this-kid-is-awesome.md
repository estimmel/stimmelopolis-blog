i've been watching some movies, not exactly one a day, but this little find is something i just needed to share instead. i found this site [ [Scopitones][] ] through one of my regular podcasts [ [Cinema Minima][] ] and although i have no idea what this kid is singing about, it's worth watching all the same [ [click here][] ] this one is cool too [ [click here][1] ]

i tried to post this the other day, but it didn't take... guess i have to learn to copyclip before i post...

btw [Mr. and Mrs. Smith][] isn't really worth paying to see...
