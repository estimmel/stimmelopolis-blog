so, i've decided that i need a personal blog... i've become more interested in blogging of late and we've set up some student blogs for the department, but i think i need something a little more freeform and personal to really get going on this. so, this will be where it all happens... or at least where it's concocted.

obviously this is a boring template... but since my web design skills are lacking at the moment i am stuck with this. perhaps i will finally sit down and learn a little and be able to customize this and add it to a full site.

btw... i am a grad student at an art school in michigan. i am 30. i study architecture and most things techie and design oriented...

...more to come
