okay, that sounds dramatic, but i think it really is the end of an era... peter is leaving and bill is coming in to take over and while i am excited and optimistic about next year, i am also a little saddened that i wasn't able to spend more time under the influence of peter...i guess i won't get into this so much because i already feel like i've discussed it ad nauseum...

i've been wrapped up in finishing out the year... cleaning, purging, planning, plotting, scheming, thinking, wishing, evaluating, hoping, dreaming, listening... everything except writing... and now i don't know exactly what to write... i should update some of my school work on that other blog and get to working on 'the where's eric project' website and the possible coincident 'the what to they know about eric project'... maybe soon...

there was also the relieving news that dad is doing well... i felt confident, but it's always comforting to know... hopefully things will only get better from here on out. i'm still confident.

well, i don't have much else to write now... should be cleaning, but with a space that barely tops 100 sq.ft. it doesn't really seem that daunting... nevertheless, i am [pleasantly] distracted by the upcoming vacation... short and scattered and unplanned as it may be... maybe that is how i like things... well, we shall see...

the cel phone is dying... battery charge doesn't last very long these days... reception is getting worse rather than better... buttons don't work so well... i really need to call cingular and work out some deal on that nice siemens phone... ugh... i guess i'll manage for a few more weeks...

okay, thoughts are not coming together here... le tigre is distracting me with ponderings on cassavettes... genius? perhaps... maybe i should watch shadows again... or the killing of a chinese bookie... or something i haven't seen... or maybe i'll just watch trainspotting... since i haven't seen that for awhile and i did just rent it... and leave the cassavettes exploration for another time...
