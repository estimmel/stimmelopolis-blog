i've been listening to this cd for some time now... andy kerr [this is his only solo album as far as i know - and difficult to come by i might add] was the guitar player for nomeansno the greatest canadian punk rock band to belt one out...

here are a couple links to play with:

never again [from Once Bitten, Twice Removed]
by andy kerr

you pick me up, you swept me off my feet
you were so good, you were so kind to me
but now i guess, you have grown tired
you cast aside, my foolish heart

the games you played, the lies you chose to tell
you told them good, you told them oh so well
but now i guess, you have grown tired
you cast aside, my foolish heart

it's time i said when, but every now and then
i need someone and my heart says no don't fall in love again

my mom and dad, and all my relatives
they gather round, oh how they put you down
i know they're right, but what i'd give to kiss your lips
and hold you close tonight

it's time i said when, but every now and then
i need someone and my heart says no don't fall in love again

it's time i said when, but every now and then
i need someone and my heart says no don't fall in love again
