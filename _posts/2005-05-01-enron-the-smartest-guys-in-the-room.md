alright, i went to a movie while i should have been working... nyah.... i had forgot [well... maybe i was just putting it aside] the woes of the california energy crisis about 5 years back... when rolling black outs were affecting different parts of the state... well watching this new enron documentary brought it all back and just pissed me off to no end... if you go watch it you will really, really be angry with the insensitive, unethical, greedy culture of power brokers... ugh.. i can't even talk about it. but go watch the movie... it's interesting.

back to work... sunrise here i come... all by my lonesome here in studio... at least i think i am alone here... [pause to listen....] spooky.
