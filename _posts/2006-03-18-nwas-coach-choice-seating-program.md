so a couple days ago i got an email from Northwest Airlines that, amidst all the general bs they send me about fares and whatnot, said this:

> Prefer an aisle or exit row seat? Northwest Introduces Coach ChoiceSM Seating! Northwest has begun saving some preferred seats (including aisle and exit row seats) in coach class until check-in, which is available 24 hours prior to departure. You can confirm these preferred seat assignments for only $15 per flight.

... what? i had heard about this, but not how it was being rolled out... this is a 'feature'? an extra fee for aisle and exit row seating? you have to be kidding me... luckily i prefer the window seats.
