today we met with the director of the academy in anticipation of finding out who made the short list of for the position of architect-in-residence. this has been widely discussed here and ill supplied with concrete information... but now we know... and not a moment too soon since the first candidate is coming tomorrow morning! ugh... this is going to be a long month... the schedule is breifly this friday and saturday the first candidate comes. this coming monday and tuesday the second one, the following friday and saturday and the subsequent monday and tuesday for the other two... this means quite a few days of not working and just interviewing/entertaining/questioning/watching/etc.

anyways, here's the short list....

[Perry Kulper][]  
[Martin Finio][]  
[Ben Nicholson][]  
[Bill Massie][]  

that's it... don't know who else applied [except a few here and there... but i think there are some confidentialities there so i'll just let that go] except that there were about 40 applicants and that at least one woman made it to the intermediate list of 8...

i'd post this on my studio blog, but i don't know if it is appropriate... and besides i can be more frank here... and frank's a fun guy to be... ;-)
