after a slow start today... awake and functioning far earlier than i would have liked, but far later than i had agreed to meet a friend to help install... 

anyways, now i head home... finally feeling a little better, but still tired... starting to get excited about going to see fantomas tomorrow in detroit... they play at [st. andrews hall][]. i've never seen them live, but they are one of my favorites... unfortunately i wasn't able to round up anyone to join me, so i will be flying solo... i don't mind and i didn't really expect anyone to want to go... not exactly mainstream these guys...

anyways, so i don't forget... here's [directions][]... mental note - print these tomorrow... so... off to rest my body and my mind... many things to do this week... many plans to make...
