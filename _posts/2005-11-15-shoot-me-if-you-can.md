[shoot me if you can][]: this is a crazy little game based on first person shooter video games, but this uses camera phones and text messages in real life... check it out. i found it while looking up [vgmap][] by eyebeam that lets you add vector drawing overlays to the google maps api... it's cool too, but still has some issues... might me something i can incorporate...
