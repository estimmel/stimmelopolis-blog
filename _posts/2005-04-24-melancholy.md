well... it's snowing here again... looks like winter isn't quite over. after walking around outside the night of the graduate degree show [that would have been friday night] discussing the possibility of 6-9 inches of fresh snow the next day, which was forcast, and listening to the locals say that it was too warm for that to happen, i was convinced that it would just be cold... but the snow is sticking... not quite 6-9 inches, but maybe 3... and although it is cold, snow is slightly prettier than just wind and rain... the trees all have that [little seen in socal] duotone outline.. white on top, black on the bottom... it's really pretty nice, but odd just a couple days after seeing white blossoms, green grass, and people walking around in shorts...

i've felt a little melancholy lately... thinking about 'the future' ... short term, long term... and then, the other day, i got a purple envelope in the mail containing a note and this picture that will be forever renamed 'melancholy' in my mind... it's strange to have something so explicitly un-cheerful bring a smile to one's face, but it happened...

so... i also saw Oldboy at the landmark theatre in royal oak... if you get a chance to see it, go... it's amazingly well shot, the soundtrack it excellent... the story is a little hard to swallow, but not so much that it gets in the way of anything... it's kind of violent [but in a way that feeds off of your imagination] so be fore warned... anyways, it closed last thursday [when i saw it] here and fortunately i got to go... i met my 'boss' from the museum and his wife and except for maybe a handful of other people we were the only ones in the theatre... which was kind of strange and familiar... but i guess i just haven't been to many movies since i've been back in school... i can remember going to many movies late at night that were just about to close... empty theatres are kind of comforting... i've also been to many movies on opening night and had to sit in the first row and watch through enormous distortion... i guess that's it for now... going to try to plow through about 6-10 more jitter tutorials tonight and read all about the fulbright program... maybe i can figure out how to get paid to study next time... :-)
