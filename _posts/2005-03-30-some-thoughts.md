first of all, i have realized that i need [really... need] to make a cooler layout for this blog... actually, maybe incorporating it into a website would be good... that should happen before the end of the school year though. i've seen some cool looking ones, and have been privy to two new versions of the blog that inspired me to start blogging since i began... anyways, that said i also wanted to add some links and some info to this site that really should go in the sidebar sometime, but i don't feel like doing it right now. so here they are...

detroit info... [[link][]]  
adult. is coming to the motor city may 6...  
.:.their [label][]  
.:.their [site][]  
autechre is coming to the motor city may 12...  
.:.tour [info][]  
.:.their [site][1]  
hafler trio...  
.:.their [site][2] [i assume it's theirs, but lots of stuff buried in this site, if you dig for it...]  

now for some meandering thoughts... well, maybe i'll just think them right now... and actually try to finish up some work...
