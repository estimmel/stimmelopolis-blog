so, what can i say about john maeda... he's a pretty amazing guy... he has several sites to look at... check out [ [Maeda Studio][] ] and [ [Simplicity][] ] and find some of his books... very geeky, but also very beautiful... see the quote below for a condensed and poignient outlook on the 'division' between science and art... [stolen from a link on [this][] page]

 anyways, i saw this project that i thought might bring a curious smile to the faces of all of my many readers... [ [oneline][] ] and i ran across his latest book [Creative Code][] in the bookstore today and i want, er... need it... :-)
 
 well... off to do a little reading... more books have made their way into my arms via the school library. now to learn something from them.
