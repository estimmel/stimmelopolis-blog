so a couple days ago dick cheney came to town... paying a special visit to someone near the campus and we got a long email explaining why we couldn't park in one of the lots for a certain time frame in the early afternoon... just happened to be the lot next to architecture and the high school... so not only did the lot i park in close, but the other lot we can park in was overrun with high school kids... ugh. here's an exerpt:

> All cars in the above listed lots should be removed from the area prior to 3:00pm, if possible. Cars still parked in those areas after 3:00 pm will be checked by law enforcement and bomb sniffing canines. During the period of 3:15 pm to approximately 4:00 pm no one will be allowed to access or move vehicles parked in these areas. The same protocol will occur from approximately 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm. 

then i got a ticket for parking somewhere i thought was okay to park during fanfare... whatever... i'm off track... i open my email today to look at the hotline [ that's what our weekly newletter of upcoming events is called which incidentally is emailed to us as a word document attached to a blank email... why it can't be in plain text in the email body i don't understand... but i digress ] at the top of the document is this statement in bold:

> **Academy students are welcome to wander Cranbrook's 350 acres. However, our Security staff may ask to see your ID. Therefore, please carry your Academy ID card with you at all times.**

okay...
