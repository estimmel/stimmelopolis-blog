alright, today was the car show at Cranbrook... lots of great looking cars, some of which you can see on my moblog... sorry no pics here... i woke up to serious thunderstorms and i thought they might have to cancel the show, but it cleared up by lunch time and just left lots of puddles and mud. all the collectors and owners were busy polishing up their babies for the judging. it was an [alfa romeo from the late 30s][] that took the best in show. it was a great looking car...

not sure what the reason was [maybe the rain...] but tonight is almost unbearable... i am laying in my room sweating because the heat and humidity are rediculously high... weather.com says 85 degress [feels like 96 degrees] with 77% humidity... at 12:45am!!! how i long for california [ lament, lament ]

anyway the movie for tonight was [All the President's Men][] and it was excellent... i have seen this one before, but not for a long time. prescient? well... kind of feels that way...

have a pleasant day... be glad you are not in SE Michigan these days... the weather is a killer...
