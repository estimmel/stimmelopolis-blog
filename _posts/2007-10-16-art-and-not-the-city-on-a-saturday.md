so, last weekend we saw [this exhibit][] at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, CT. it was amazing and goes through February 24th, 2008 so if you are in the area it is well worth the trip. ( it is especially nice in the fall, of which there is still some left... ) my favorite piece was called "Opera for a Small Room" by Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller. after doing a [bit][] [of][] [digging][] on the internet, i can't believe i was so unfamiliar with them... a wonderful surprise and a [few][] [books][] to add to my wishlist. i'll leave you with a picture of ["Opera for a Small Room"][] from their website...
