the architecture department, actually two people from the architecture department, puts on a chair design show annually and tonight we had a meeting to finalize the schedule. the show will be called Holy Sit! which is kind of funny and irreverent which i like, but also kind of silly which i'm not too sure about... anyways, i don't have strong feeling either way. it's a group show and it will be what it will be... which i think will be pretty quality.

the chair i am contemplating is, assuming i can afford the parts and learn what needs to be learned which is a lot as usual, basically a low-rider hydraulic style piece... i have a few ideas about how to configure this that are very undeveloped, but you should basically be able to raise and lower all four corners individually or in unison... the frame will be powder coated steel [thinking about pipe but probably have to go with angle iron] and the seat should probably be apholstered with vinyl or leather... but might end up being something less fabricy... since i have limited skills in that area too... oops... phone call. time to go.

forgot about the television part there... i've taken to [well it's been quite some time running now] acquiring copies of currently airing television programs and watching them on my computer... partly because i can't/couldn't always get to a tv when they aired [and you can't miss one episode of say 24 and be able to follow the overarching plot] and partly so that i could watch them without commercials at my leisure...

but, i think i am easily distracted by these things and i don't know how i feel about some of the shows i am addicted to... it's an odd feeling. the shows i am currently following has shrunk dramatically since coming back to school, because of time constraints, to include 24, alias, and carnivale [i would also include spooks which i love, but i seem to have missed the airing schedule and can't find the third season in all the usual places] 

side note... i still find it interesting that we refer to websites, newsgroups, and similar databases and archives as places or sites or use other names connotating a physical location to describe them and our process of looking at them [go to www.insertfavoriteurl.com, i went to this great site, etc.]... it is comforting and yet, as with most technologies that are integrated into our lives, glossed over without thought by most people... i have a feeling that, like the plot lines of 24, those words are an attempt [i wonder about the history of the terminology... mental note to research this] to make things that we should question and understand [but not necessarily fear or worry about] like something that we are comfortable with... there seems to be a fine line between making someone comfortable with some thing or concept or course-of-action and actually helping them understand that thing, concept or course-of-action... i hope that in my work i can do the later... for myself as well as for others.

but back to my stories... my prime time, cable, and bbc addictions... i have [and i mean this like a true addict] have to watch the latest episodes of 24 and carnivale tonight... but work beckons first... so off to it.
