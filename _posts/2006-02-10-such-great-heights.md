iron and wine **such great heights**

> [ excerpt ] I am thinking it's a sign That the freckles in our eyes Are mirror images and When we kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate That God himself did make us into Corresponding shapes like puzzles pieces From the clay True, it may seem like a stretch But it's thoughts like this That catch my troubled head When you're away, when I am missing you to death [ /exerpt ]
