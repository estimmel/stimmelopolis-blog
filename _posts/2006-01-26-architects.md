just heard [ er, read ] about the PA Award winners [ [click here to read about them][] ] and peter lynch won! for a project here on cranbrook's campus for a project that i kind of thought wasn't going to go through... maybe this will help revive it. anyway, it got me thinking about a minor little disagreement i had over the holidays... i went to the monterey bay aquarium and mentioned that i thought the architect of that building was the same architect that designed the university union at cal poly slo... i couldn't remember his name, but i thought it started with an 'E' ... to make a long story short(er) i did a little digging around and figured out that it was Joseph Esherick who designed the [Monterey Bay Aquarium][] [ 1988 ] and the [Julian A. McPhee University Union][] [ 1973 ] in fact he was honored by the AIA for both... woohoo! i win!! okay, back to work.
