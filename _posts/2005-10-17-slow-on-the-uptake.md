so... i know i haven't been posting a lot here lately, but i have an excuse.... i swear, i have been working on my studio blog... it's [here][] now... and after all that trouble moving this blog away from blogger and my lofty aspirations of getting the studio onto wordpress and onto the school's servers... i seem to have deviated slightly.

the new blogs will be on blogger... and i've also started using [flickr][] which is super cool [ i don't want to hear it from those of you who have touted it's virtues to me for months ] and am trying to teach the rest of the studio about it as well... some of them know... and i've put some links to their blogs on my site too so you can check them out there until i get the main studio page up and running...

until then, look at [my flickr pictures][] and learn to love [flickr][] and the way tags work.
