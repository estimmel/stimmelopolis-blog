okay...

i am still alive.

feeling a little overwhelmed here... school has started without even consulting me. i'm not quite ready for it to start yet... i still have summer projects in motion... i haven't had time to set up the studio computer lab... i can't even imagine taking on a new project right now even though i long to be working on something new...

for now i feel stretched to my limits, but i will resurface soon... brighter and with new focus.
