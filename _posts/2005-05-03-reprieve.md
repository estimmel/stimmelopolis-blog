trying to finish the semester with a successful [in my assessment] series of projects... the student auction is coming this weekend along with the CAA video festival and prior to that final reviews. i was successful in throwing together a quick 2 minute film for the festival and have made a significant [and sleep depriving] run at getting things into the auction... unfortunately i was unable to finish the main project for that, but was given a slight reprieve... which really only means i must get up now and finish it... hopefully i have left enough time. quick shower, shave... food. back to studio. here i go...
