when you find the perfect quote or song you are very lucky indeed... it isn't hard to find something that is nearly what you are looking for, but exactly... that is a true gem. of course, there are ways to approach this precision by accretion [for example, in making a compilation cd you can choose 15 or 20 songs which say many things that when taken together and shared with the right person (from the right person and at the right time - wow...) begin to speak the complexity of feelings and thoughts that are specific to the moment] or by contextual proximity [as, when coupled with shared memories and personal references, a single quote from a movie or from a text may be able to do... it may express something approaching that perfect communication]

i guess you may expect me to impart one of these gems to you here; that would be a good climax and explain why i am thinking about things like this... but i don't have one to share... i am thinking about this in reference to the work i am doing.

the thought i had, which surfaced around the time of my critique on friday [or thereabout] is one of tolerance... my work [and i may have been misguided in thinking it was otherwise] has been about recognizing the point at which a struggle for precision and the inevitable failure to achieve it at a certain level is regarded as a failing of the process [and a novel moment to be explored and refined in an ever advancing drive toward perfection] or as that without which the work is soul-less...

i'm not sure where this idea will take me... or how to address it in the immediate future, but i think it is worth holding onto. i have always felt distanced from the argument that it is 'improper' or 'sacrilegious' to strive for perfection... i feel a kinship with those who seek it and have always felt a little uneasy patting myself on the back for those 'happy accidents' that seem to make things unique and beautiful... this is not to say that i don't recognize the beauty and revolutions of thought that can [and do] come from those same accidents... and i am [as i have recently been told] a connoisseur of ambiguity and there is a wonderful beauty in the unspoken, implied, ...
