came across this somewhere... seemed like fun and you can put the results on a blog easily enough [ or so they tell me ]

first, the politics test:

You are a


**Social Liberal**
(78% permissive)


and an...


**Economic Moderate**
(41% permissive)


You are best described as a:


**Democrat**

next, the commonly misused words test:

**English Genius**
You scored 92% Beginner, 92% Intermediate, 93% Advanced, and 80% Expert!

You did so extremely well, even *I* can't find a word to describe your excellence! You have the uncommon intelligence necessary to understand things that most people don't. You have an extensive vocabulary, and you're not afraid to use it properly! Way to go!


Thank you so much for taking my test. I hope you enjoyed it!

and so... while the first test is no surprise to me and the statement at the top of the second test reassures me that i am in fact an english genius i'm not quite sure what the 'you scored higher than...' section of the second test is telling me... seems like i am a genius, but so is most of my demographic... either that or there are quite a few cheaters out there... not sure what to think about it, but i felt obligated to post the results since i took the test with that intention.
