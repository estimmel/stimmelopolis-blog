i went to new york this past weekend [friday thru tuesday] and had the most relaxing and enjoyable five days in recent memory... i should write quite a bit here describing it, but the adventures seem to be catching up with me and after struggling to choose the right photos to post and trying to get them in order and whatever else i was doing [doesn't look like much...] i've realized that i am not too facile at this blogging thing...

i'll try to get more images up tomorrow and add a little more detail about the trip... until then enjoy the pictures and learn to love the city; i have! here are a few people pics that i particularly liked...
