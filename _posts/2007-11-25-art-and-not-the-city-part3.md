a few weeks ago we went to [Storm King Art Center][] in Mountainville, NY on the west side of the Hudson River. we drove up there to see once again, the fall colors that live outside of the city... i guess we truely are [leafers][] but it couldn't have been a nicer day to be there! we were lucky to get up there when we did since it was the second to last weekend the grounds remained open for the season. most of the art center consists of outdoor sculptures and there is only a small building housing some additional works. we didn't even go inside except in search of a snack ( which we could not find! apparently there is no cafe or restaurant... ) we will be more prepared on a second visit and bring a picnic lunch. the stone wall by Andy Goldsworthy was impressive and very well suited as were the Richard Serra pieces, but it was of course the beautiful fall colors that made it such a refreshing afternoon. see for yourself...
