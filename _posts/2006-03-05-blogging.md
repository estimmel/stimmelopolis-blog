well... this blog has been degraded to a list of links... [ as was so kindly pointed out by yet another prolific "[blogger][]" ahem... just poking back :) ] but, point well taken. i think i'll be turning off the del.icio.us autoposting... it's pretty boring and i don't use the links from here; i have them on del.icio.us right? if you want to keep up with my links i'm [here][] so add me to your del.icio.us inbox or just check me out periodically.... anyway, some slightly less boring news. i just finished reviews at cranbrook... that was exciting. some good comments that i should probably write down on my studio blog. i also got my laptop fixed. the hard drive just died. fortunately i was still under the extended warranty [ applecare just paid for itself ] able to use [carbon copy cloner][] to get a complete backup [ after several tries due to the failing drive ] which was smoothly reinstalled after reviews in just about 15-20 minutes and all seems to be unharmed. whew. just a reminder... back up you sh!t. i've also decided i really love the [Delicious Library][] [ mac only... sorry pc-ers ] and although the [DeliciWeb][] plugin doesn't do the application justice, it's still pretty cool in it's own right and gives me a way to publish [my library][] on the web. ahh... good times. that's about all i can muster right now. hope that's okay with all 3 of my readers... i promise to muse a little more often and a little more interesting in the future...
