so, this kid in germany found a way to install linux on his ipod... brilliant!

here are two articles about it.. the [new scientist][] breaking news is where i first read about it, but then [boingboing][] had a little more interesting analysis of what kind of creative mind it took to do this... this kind of thing makes me happy to be in a moment in time when geeks around the world can spread their ideas and successes [and presumably failures as well] so quickly and so prolifically...
