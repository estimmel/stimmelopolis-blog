since i've been in new york, i've continually been presented with the names of neighborhoods ( alphabet city, stuytown, murray hill, nolita, etc ) that i had never heard of... and they were always dropped, nonchalantly, as if that's all i needed to know where the person was talking about, sometimes to the block! well, having been here almost a year now, i can understand how that is possible, but i still am forever trying to track down where some area is... [wikipedia][] to the rescue! check out the awesome listing of neighborhoods with links. here's the great map as well.
