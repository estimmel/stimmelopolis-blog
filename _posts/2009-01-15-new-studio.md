I've got a new studio space in Greenpoint. It's a shared space, but so far I'm mostly there by myself which is sort of nice. I've barely moved in so I don't really have much to show for it, but here's a little video I made of my first day actually making something in the studio. I made a [Digg Button][] designed by Limor Fried. It's designed to be reprogrammed, but I haven't quite finished setting up my studio PC... somehow I can't find the keyboard... guess it's back to search the storage unit one of these days...
