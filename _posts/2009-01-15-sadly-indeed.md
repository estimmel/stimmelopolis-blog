--- So many times I read [xkcd][] and get a [glimpse][] of that [once possible future][], the one where I pursue higher mathematics and have the intellectual prowess to make jokes that *are* truly funny, but somehow over my head. It gives me that good kind of anxiety that comes from being surrounded by really smart people. Other times I read it and see the [present][] and it makes me laugh out loud because *that's* really funny too (and still contains some pseudo-intellectual chicanery). Other times, I see my life so clearly in these little stick figure gems that I can barely believe it. (That's when I start sweeping for bugs...)

This, sadly or not, is *not* a true story for me, but the circumstances and \\*ahem\\* tendencies are all pretty much par for the course.
