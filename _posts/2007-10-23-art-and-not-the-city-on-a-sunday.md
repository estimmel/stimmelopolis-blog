this past weekend, in our continued quest to "see the [fall][] [colors][]", we took another day trip. this time we took the train up to the [Dia:Beacon][]. it was really beautiful; the train ride goes right up alongside the [hudson river][] and the museum is just a 5 minute walk from the station. even that parking lot was well designed ( i chalk this observation up to having lived in highly car-dominated parts of the country for most of my life )... it's hard to say what my favorite exhibit was, everything was fantastic... the torqued ellipses by richard serra, the drawings by sol lewitt, the light installations by dan flavin... but i think it's fair to say that i was really impressed with the [installation][] by [on kawara][]; a new name to me, but ( perhaps as a consequence of recently being exposed to [some][] [other][] long-time-span type of projects ) this one held my attention. especially the 100 year calendar that was on display with the paintings. jenn and i took some time deciphering it and determined that he was born on December 24, 1933... we were off by a year though i'm not quite sure how... here's one example of the paintings on display that happens to have been painted on a somewhat special day... ![On Kawara - June 16, 1966][]
