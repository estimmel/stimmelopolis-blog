so... the gps search continues... now i am looking at the [Holux GM-210][] which i have heard to be cheaper and perhaps smaller... i will have to research a little more...

and doesn't it always happen this way... my previous gps [eTrex Legend] was giving me such a headache trying to communicate with my powerbook that i decided to sell it on ebay [maybe i mentioned this earlier] and buy a new puck style gps like the holux above... well, my friend just sent me a links explaining how to make this work!! so... if you are doing the same thing... try [this][].

and another thing... my listing ends in less than an hour and the school internet is going to be down for some kind of service, uh, well... in about 4 min.... so i have to wait until tomorrow to see what it sold for!! aaarrrggghhhh!!!

ah, well... i should be working anyways.

back to it.
